### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Although a most of my help were from online resources, all of the topics discussed in the labs prepared me to complete the assignment. Especially learning about API, I had some experience with HTML and CSS before so that part wasn't too hard but API was a new thing to me and I think it helped a lot on implementing some of my stretch features like searching by genres or getting extra details about a movie.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would love to try to improve the youtube embeds loading speed. Adding each trailers to a separate has slowed down the web page a lot. I also want to fix a few more things like some of the movies ID were false and the API would return a 401 error. I want to have some kind of placeholder. An additional feature I would like to add to this project is letting the user add their review or rating to the database. I saw there was a POST method or giving rating but I think it would be time consuming since I'm not too familiar with it. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Getting the search by genre to work and the popup went well in the end, I definitely struggled a lot. One things that didn't go as planned and I noticed someone mention that is about the youtube embeds. It's causing my website to be really slow because it takes a little bit of time to load. A peer mentioned that they were using promises so I would love to look into that and improve the running speed of the site.
